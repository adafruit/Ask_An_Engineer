# Ask_An_Engineer
Related to the Ask an Engineer videocast. Ask your questions anytime by posting here.

## How to:

Post your questions under the latest date for consideration under the current year (2024)

You can just post an Issue if you aren't familiar with GitHub.
If you're comfortable, you can do a Pull Request for the day you'd like your question answered. 

**The format for requests:**

Name:  Please provide your name or social media handle

Question:   Please keep it to engineering/making/Adafruit Products or product suggestions, etc.

**An example:**

Name: Jane Smith (or use something like @janeSmith on X/Instagram/Mastodon/Discord, etc.)

Question: I'd like to run my Raspberry Pi RP2040 project on solar power, how would I best go about it?

**Other good question examples:**

* Adafruit has a Feather doubler, tripler, and quad. I could really use a board with five slots. Ideas?
* Where can I find out more about Adafruit IO and example code?
* How are things going in the new Brooklyn factory space?
